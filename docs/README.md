 Swift-like programming language, created for medium level system programming and embedded development.

* Modern syntax for clear and readable code
* Strong type system protects your code from occasional bugs
* Medium level language (like C) - makes it suitable for system and embedded development

Strong typed, concise syntax, medium level programming language, that you can translate to LLVM IR or C language output (just choose preferred backend).
Now language and compiler on research & development stage.
