# Known Bugs

Found 2026-06-11 while verifying documentation against the compiler
(merged 2026-07-29 with the older, previously-duplicated root-level BUGS.md).

## 5. `builtin.*` namespace does not resolve (regression)

```modest
var w: builtin.target.Word        // error: via import is forbidden
let v = builtin.compiler.version  // error: unknown value
```

The wiring exists (`create_builtin_module`, auto-import at
`src/semantic.py:2707`), but any `builtin.x` access fails with
`unknown value`. The repo's own `tests/builtin` fails with 10 errors —
it is not listed in `tests/run.sh`, so the regression went unnoticed.
Affects everything documented in `docs/lang/builtin_constants.md`.

## 6. Empty slice assignment target emits a C zero-length array

```modest
var a: [5]Int32 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
let s = a[2:2]
```

Generates `int32_t s[2 - 2];`, which clang only accepts as a GNU
extension (`-Wzero-length-array` under `-pedantic`). Array size comes
straight from the slice's `volume` expression with no zero-length case;
see `do_ctype_array_volume` in `src/backend/c11.py:210`. Reproduced by
`testEmptySlice` in `tests/slice/src/main.m` (passes, but only because
`-pedantic` warnings aren't treated as errors).

## 7. Postfix operators after a slice are silently dropped

```modest
let x = arr[1:3][0]
// compiles; x becomes the slice, [0] vanishes
```

- Cause: `expr_value_11` returns immediately after parsing a slice instead of
  continuing the postfix loop; the trailing `[0]` is then parsed as a
  standalone array-literal statement and discarded by codegen.
- Expected: postfix ops after a slice apply to the slice result (or are
  rejected with a diagnostic).

## 8. Unterminated record type hangs the compiler

```modest
type Broken = {
	x: Int32
// EOF here — mcc spins forever, no diagnostic
```

- Cause: the field loop in `parse_type_record` (`src/parser.py`) has no
  end-of-input check; at EOF `parse_stmt_field` keeps producing empty
  identifiers without consuming anything.
- Expected: `error: expected '}'` (unexpected end of file) and exit.

## 9. Fields of function-local record types are inaccessible (needs triage)

```modest
func main () -> Int32 {
	type L = { a: Int32 }
	var v: L
	v.a = 7        // error: access to private field of record
	return v.a
}
```

The same record defined at module level works fine. Possibly the
access-level check ties the local definition to the wrong scope.
