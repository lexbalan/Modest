# Comments

Comments are intended for the programmer, and do not affect the compilation and execution of the program. Depending on the selected backend, they can be transferred to the output text (this works for C & Modest backend).

### Multi-line comment
```swift
/* This is a
   multiline comment */
```

### Single-line comment
```swift
// This is a single-line comment
```
