 Swift&Golang-like programming language, created for medium level system programming and embedded development.
 
* Modern syntax for clear and readable code
* Strong type system protects your code from occasional bugs
* Minimal runtime for true freedom

Strong typed, concise syntax, medium level programming language, that you can translate to LLVM IR or C language output ([just choose backend](./docs/USAGE.md)).
